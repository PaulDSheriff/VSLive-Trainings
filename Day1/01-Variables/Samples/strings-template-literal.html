      Another way to declare strings is to use the back-tick character (`).
      <br />
      This is called a template literal.
      <br />
      You can include any other special characters within a template literal.

    // is to use the back-tick character.
    // This is called a template literal.
    // You can include any other special
    // characters within a template literal.
    movie = `A String with both "Double" and 'Single' Quotes`;

    movie = "Young Frankenstein";
    let rating = "R";
    let price = 9.99;

    // Another use of template literals is
    // to perform string substitution
    // Use the ${var} syntax to place the value
    // within the 'var' variable directly into the string
    let info = `The movie '${movie}' is rated '${rating}' and costs $${price}`;
    console.log(info);
    console.log("");

    // Literals can include a line break
    info = `The movie '${movie}' is rated '${rating}'
cost =  $${price}`;
    console.log(info);
    console.log("");

    // You can call functions and perform 
    // math operations within a template literal
    console.log("Can use expressions (1 + 1 = ${1 + 1}) is " + `1 + 1 = ${1 + 1}`);
